            <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
            <p>Javascript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. Javascript is extremely popular for a variert of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language 
            allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. Javascript lives inside a host enviorment(a web browers or node server),
            it can be connected to the objects of these enviorments to provide programmatic control over them. 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="variable Dec">Variable Declaration</a><p>JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds
            the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These names are called identifiers.<span>var x;</span></p></li>
                <li><a href="variable ass">Variable Assignment</a><p>Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee piured in it, giving
                our variable a value to holf. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.<span>var x = 10;</span></p></li>
                <li><a href="data types">Data Types</a><p>Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data
             types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span>true</span> or <span>false;</span> null - <span>null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span>42</span> or <span>3.14159; 
             </span> String - <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span>[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span>{first_name:'jane', last_name:'Doe'}</span></p></li>
                <li><a href="Conditional">Conditionals</a><p>When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on
                values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accompliuh this. There are the following conditional statements:
                <span>if</span> a specified condition is true, do this in our code block; <span>else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false;
                <span>else</span> we execute this block of code;</p></li>
                <li><a href="Loop">Loops</a><p>There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an
                action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</p></li>
                <li><a href="Function">Function</a><p>Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as 
                a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs
                to the tabke top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finsihed our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function
                over and over and over again.</p></li>
